    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Daal Bhaat is a traditional South Asian meal, particularly popular in Nepal, India, and Bangladesh. It consists of two main components: "daal," a spiced lentil soup, and "bhaat," steamed rice. The daal is made by cooking lentils with a variety of spices like turmeric, cumin, garlic, and ginger, giving it a rich and savory flavor. Bhaat is usually plain white rice, which serves as the perfect base to complement the daal. Often, the dish is accompanied by side dishes such as vegetables, pickles, or fried fish, enhancing its taste. Daal Bhaat is known for its comforting and nutritious qualities, making it a staple in everyday meals. It's both filling and satisfying, offering a balanced combination of protein from the lentils and carbohydrates from the rice.
