    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Dosa is a traditional South Indian dish made from fermented rice and urad dal (black gram) batter, which is thin and crispy when cooked on a hot griddle. It is a versatile dish that can be served plain or stuffed with various fillings, such as spiced mashed potatoes. Dosa is typically enjoyed with chutneys (such as coconut, tomato, or mint) and sambar, a flavorful lentil-based stew. It is commonly eaten for breakfast or dinner, loved for its delicious flavor and satisfying texture.</p>

        <li>1/4 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (optional)</li>
        <li>Water (for soaking and grinding)</li>

        <li>Boiled potatoes (2-3 medium-sized)</li>
        <li>Onion (1 medium-sized, finely chopped)</li>
        <li>Green chilies (2, chopped)</li>
        <li>Mustard seeds (1 teaspoon)</li>
        <li>Turmeric powder (1/2 teaspoon)</li>
        <li>Curry leaves (a few leaves)</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>Oil or ghee (for frying)</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander leaves (for garnish, optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>For Dosa Batter:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Soak the Rice and Dal:</strong> Wash the rice and urad dal thoroughly. Soak the rice, dal, and fenugreek seeds (if using) in water for 4-6 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li><strong>Grind the Batter:</strong> Drain the soaked rice and dal. In a wet grinder or blender, grind the rice and dal separately or together, adding water gradually to form a smooth, thick batter. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Ferment the Batter:</strong> Transfer the batter to a large bowl, cover it, and leave it in a warm place to ferment for 8-12 hours (overnight). The batter will rise and become slightly bubbly.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Salt:</strong> Once fermented, add salt to taste and mix the batter well. The batter should be of pouring consistency; add water if needed to adjust the texture.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>For Dosa Filling (Optional):</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> Heat oil in a pan and add mustard seeds. Once they splutter, add curry leaves, chopped onions, and green chilies. Saut√© until the onions turn golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Turmeric and Potatoes:</strong> Add turmeric powder and mashed boiled potatoes to the pan. Stir well and cook for a few minutes. Add salt to taste and garnish with fresh coriander leaves. Set aside.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>To Make Dosa:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Heat the Griddle:</strong> Heat a non-stick tawa (griddle) or cast-iron pan over medium heat. Lightly grease it with oil or ghee.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread the Batter:</strong> Once the pan is hot, pour a ladle of batter onto the center and spread it in a circular motion to form a thin, even layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Dosa:</strong> Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the edges start to lift and the bottom turns golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the Dosa:</strong> If making a stuffed dosa, place a portion of the prepared potato filling in the center of the dosa. Fold the dosa over the filling and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the dosa hot with chutney (coconut, tomato, or mint) and sambar on the side. Enjoy your crispy, delicious dosa!</li>
